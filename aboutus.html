  <h1>About Us and Our Mission</h1>
	<p>We had a dream that one day we could explore space up close and in vivid detail, and that time is now! We want you to be apart of it with us. It's not everyday you get to set foot on other planets and moons and fly by other stars.</p>
	
	<h3>Our Timeline</h3>
	<p>We were founded back in June 2000, in San Diego, California. With our team being made up of scientist with a passion for traveling and space exploration, we knew we had to do something.</p>
	<p>From 2000 to 2007, we worked hard and studied more indepth into engineering, astronomy, and biology. With that background, we slowly came up with many findings and ideas in which to put into action. Throught those years, we also studied our own galaxy using the knowledge and skills we had, along with help from NASA. That is when we knew we wanted to travel and take a tour of our own galaxy. So we did just that!</p>
	<p>With the help and company of NASA, we spent from 2009 to 2020 taking a personal tour of Milky Way Galaxy. Let us just say, it was the most incredible thing ever experienced by any human ever! We now, after 20 years, get to share our experiences with the rest of the world and change lives.</p>
	<p>Our mission is to take YOU on a journey through the galaxy in which you will learn so much and have the time of your life.</p>
